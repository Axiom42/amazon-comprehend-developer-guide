# Detecting Key Phrases<a name="how-key-phrases"></a>

You can use Amazon Comprehend operations to detect entities and key phrases in your document\.

The [DetectKeyPhrases](API_DetectKeyPhrases.md) and [BatchDetectKeyPhrases](API_BatchDetectKeyPhrases.md) operations detect the key phrases in a document\. A *key phrase* is a string containing a noun phrase that describes a particular thing\. It generally consists of a noun and the modifiers that distinguish it\. For example, "day" is a noun; "a beautiful day" is a noun phrase that includes an article \("a"\) and an adjective \("beautiful"\)\. Each key phrase includes a score that indicates the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has that the string is a noun phrase\. You can use the score to determine if the detection has high enough confidence for your application\.
